# HP Printer meets AntiX Linux
oK LET ME BE CLEAR. i REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHY ALL THESE STEPS WORK.
They worked for me so here they are.

## Basic formatting
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cups
sudo apt-get install cups-browsed
sudo apt-get install cups-filters
sudo service cups start
```

after which you should be able to login in browser using

```html
http://localhost:631
```
## HPLIP
*It would probably be better to install HPLIP also while we are at it as no harm done.
I don't think so the system made any use of it but I may be mistaken.*
As in [Install HP Printer drivers in Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and elementary OS : FossLinux](https://www.fosslinux.com/1547/install-hp-printer-drivers-in-ubuntu-linux-mint-and-elementary-os.htm)
We 
- check if we already have HPLIP via `dpkg -l hplip` *not there*
- decided not to install HPLIP from [Get HPLIP](https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/gethplip) as we have no idea of the COMPATIBILITY with our system or the distribution
- decided to go with 
```bash 
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   sudo apt install hplip hplip-gui
   ``` 
   as we felt it would be more compatible with our system


## An aside
AntiX is not a systemd distro. So, systemctl won't work in it. So tutorials such as [Installing Printers in Linux | CUPS, Printing, and Scanning - YouTube : Chris Titus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En2DJAMpwmY&pp=ygUcaHAgcHJpbnRlciBub3Qgd29ya2luZyBsaW51eA%3D%3D)
won't work off the bat. We need to improvise. So we looked at [How to Fix "Systemctl Command Not Found" Error in Linux](https://allthings.how/how-to-fix-systemctl-command-not-found-error-in-linux/)
There we got the idea of replacing systemctl with service.
So we have `sudo service cups start` instead of `sudo systemctl enable cups 
sudo systemctl start cups`

## Continuing further
We have this page for CUPS

We then click on the highlighted area ![image](https://github.com/TejasAvinashShetty/silvercloud/assets/27445854/0406d58b-fa38-4f58-859b-5505de8546d3)
This leads us to ![image](https://github.com/TejasAvinashShetty/silvercloud/assets/27445854/63472cff-8c25-457f-a344-2144f92bb400)
If you read throughly through this you may be able to do every thing by the command line.
But at least I am not so pedantic.
Just click on the portion  encircled in red ink

We will get the following. Click on the **Add printer**

This goes to what we see below. Select the printer as below. If it is not present try reconnecting the printer and praying to god.

Hopefully you are lucky and just follow the on screen instruction here on.

If at any time, you don't end up getiing a printout just  delete all the printers you have in CUPS and start over again.


### extra info 
From [Installing Printers in Linux | CUPS, Printing, and Scanning - YouTube : Chris Titus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En2DJAMpwmY&pp=ygUcaHAgcHJpbnRlciBub3Qgd29ya2luZyBsaW51eA%3D%3D)

It seems to do stuff from the command line you could do the following

CUPS Setup - localhost:631

Setup user with modification to use printers

```bash

sudo usermod -aG lpadmin username
```
