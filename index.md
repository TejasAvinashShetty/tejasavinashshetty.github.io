Dear citizen of the internet,

Welcome to my space. I am a researcher in the field of Quantum Control and Quantum Computing. I have completed my PhD in physics from IIT Bombay. 
My thesis topic is "Optimal control in quantum computing"

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Meta analysis of method in Quantum control like GRAPE, GOAT, CRAB, DCRAB, Krotov, etc
- New methods that fill in the gaps uncovered by the analysis above
- A prescription for which method to use when  (quantum control)
