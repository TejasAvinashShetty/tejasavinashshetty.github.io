Dear citizen of the internet,
Welcome to my space. I am a researcher in the field of Quantum Control and Quantum Computing. I have completed my PhD in physics from IIT Bombay. 
My thesis topic is "Optimal control in quantum computing"

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Meta analysis of method in Quantum control like GRAPE, GOAT, CRAB, DCRAB, Krotov, etc
- new methods that fill in the gaps 
- a prescription for which method to use when (quantum control)
